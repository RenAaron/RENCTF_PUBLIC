# RenCTF

RenCTF is an interactive, team-based platform designed to teach penetration testing (pentesting) skills. Combining web application functionality with hardware integration, RenCTF provides a unique and engaging experience for participants. This project was developed by **RenAaron Ellis** and **Dr. Zuzak**.

## Features

### Web Application
- **Frontend Framework**: Built using Angular.
- **Data Hosting**: Firebase is utilized for hosting user and game data.
- **API Integration**: Stubbed-out API keys are included in the `Webapp` directory in the `master` branch.

### Server
- **Backend Hosting**: Heroku serves as the backend hosting solution.
- Stubbed-out API keys for the server can be found in the `Server` directory on the `main` branch.

### Hardware Integration
- **Components**:
  - 64x64 LED Matrix.
  - 5.5‚Äù HDMI OLED Display.
  - Raspberry Pi ZERO WH.
  - Custom 3D-Printed Case.
- The LED matrix visually displays:
  - Leaderboard.
  - Game status.
  - Other media.

### Activities
- Solve Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges via third-party platforms such as PicoCTF.
- Submit correct flags through the web app to climb the leaderboard.
- Engage in grid-based board games including:
  - Othello/Go.
  - Connect4.
  - Super TIC-TAC-TOE.

## Development Tools
RenCTF was developed using the following technologies:
- **Firebase**: For front-end hosting and database management.
- **Angular**: To build the web application's frontend.
- **Heroku**: For backend/server hosting.
- **Blender**: For rendering web app and matrix GIFs.
- **Fusion360**: For designing 3D-printed hardware housing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have the following installed:
